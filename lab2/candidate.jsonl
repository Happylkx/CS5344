Wind breakouts on timescales of a day or longer\nare currently the most probable for detection. Here we study the signal that\nfollows such events. We start from the breakout of the radiation mediated\nshock, finding that the breakout temperature can vary significantly from one\nevent to another ($10^4 - 5 \\times 10^6$ K) due to possible deviation from\nthermal equilibrium. In general, events with longer breakout pulse duration,\n$t_{bo}$, are softer. We follow the observed radiation through the evolution of\nthe collisionless shock which forms after the breakout of the radiation\nmediated shock. We restrict the study of the collisionless shock evolution to\ncases where the breakout itself is in thermal equilibrium, peaking in\noptical/UV. In these cases the post-breakout emission contains two spectral\ncomponents - soft (optical/UV) and hard (X-rays and possibly soft\n$\\gamma$-rays).

{"id": "0912.4990", "abstract": "  (Abridged) X-ray observations of synchrotron rims in supernova remnant (SNR)\nshocks show evidence of strong magnetic field amplification (a factor of ~100\nbetween the upstream and downstream medium). This amplification may be due to\nplasma instabilities driven by shock-accelerated cosmic rays (CRs). One\ncandidate is the cosmic ray current-driven (CRCD) instability (Bell 2004),\ncaused by the electric current of large Larmor radii CRs propagating parallel\nto the upstream magnetic field. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations have shown\nthat the back-reaction of the amplified field on CRs would limit the\namplification factor of this instability to less than ~10 in galactic SNRs. In\nthis paper, we study the possibility of further amplification driven near\nshocks by \"magnetized\" CRs, whose Larmor radii are smaller than the length\nscale of the field that was previously amplified by the CRCD instability. We\nfind that additional amplification can occur due to a new instability, driven\nby the CR current perpendicular to the field, which we term the \"perpendicular\ncurrent-driven instability\" (PCDI). We derive the growth rate of this\ninstability, and, using PIC simulations, study its non-linear evolution and\nsaturation. We find that PCDI increases the amplification of the field\n(amplification factor up to ~45, not including the shock compression) and\ndiscuss its observational signatures.

However,\ndue to the sensor noise, high redundancy, incompleteness, and complexity of\nairborne LiDAR systems, point cloud classification is challenging. In this\npaper, we proposed a directionally constrained fully convolutional neural\nnetwork (D-FCN) that can take the original 3D coordinates and LiDAR intensity\nas input; thus, it can directly apply to unstructured 3D point clouds for\nsemantic labeling. Specifically, we first introduce a novel directionally\nconstrained point convolution (D-Conv) module to extract locally representative\nfeatures of 3D point sets from the projected 2D receptive fields. To make full\nuse of the orientation information of neighborhood points, the proposed D-Conv\nmodule performs convolution in an orientation-aware manner by using a\ndirectionally constrained nearest neighborhood search.

Their calculations suggest, that magnetic flux-ropes (plasmoids) are\nformed in full range of scales by a cascade of tearing and coalescence\nprocesses. Consequently, the initially thick current layer becomes highly\nfragmented. Thus, the tearing and coalescence cascade can cause an effective\nenergy transfer across the scales.

We find that bars are preferentially found in galaxies\nthat are massive and dynamically cold (rotation-dominated) and on the stellar\nTully-Fisher relationship, as is the case for barred spirals in the local\nUniverse. The data provide at least one explanation for the steep ($\\times$3)\ndecline in the overall bar fraction from z=0 to z=0.84 in L$^*$ and brighter\ndisks seen in previous studies. The decline in the bar fraction at high\nredshift is almost exclusively in the lower mass (10 $<$ log M$_{*}$(\\Msun)$<$\n11), later-type and bluer galaxies. A proposed explanation for this\n\"downsizing\" of the bar formation / stellar structure formation is that the\nlower mass galaxies may not form bars because they could be dynamically hotter\nthan more massive systems from the increased turbulence of accreting gas,\nelevated star formation, and/or increased interaction/merger rate at higher\nredshifts. The evidence presented here provides observational support for this\nhypothesis. However, the data also show that not every disk galaxy that is\nmassive and cold has a stellar bar, suggesting that mass and dynamic coldness\nof a disk are necessary but not sufficient conditions for bar formation -- a\nsecondary process, perhaps the interaction history between the dark matter halo\nand the baryonic matter, may play an important role in bar formation.\n"}

In analogy with\nthe invariant mass m, the IQE is invariant under local boosts of the set of\nobservers on a given two-surface S in spacetime.

Variations in the mean\nstrength of the solar magnetic field lead to significant shifts in the\nfrequencies of even the lowest-degree p modes with high levels of correlation\nwith surface activity proxies. These frequency shifts are explained to arise\nfrom structural changes in the outer layers of the Sun during the 11-year\nactivity cycle, which is understood to be driven by a dynamo process. However,\nclear differences between p-mode frequencies and surface activity during the\nextended minimum of cycle 23 were observed. The origin of the p-mode\nvariability is thus far from being properly understood and a better\ncomprehension of its relationship with solar and stellar activity cycles will\nhelp us in our understanding of the dynamo processes.

With the goal of\nunderstanding the physical state, origin, and evolution of the gas in young\ndebris disks, we obtained CO line observations with the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Here we report on the detection of 12CO\nand 13CO in the J=2-1 and J=3-2 transitions and C18O in the J=2-1 line. The gas\nexhibits a Keplerian velocity curve, one of the few direct measurements of\nKeplerian rotation in young debris disks. The measured CO brightness\ndistribution could be reproduced by a simple star+disk system, whose parameters\nare r_in < 26 AU, r_out = 138 +/- 20 AU, M_*=1.8 +0.5 -0.2 M_Sun, and i = 32.6\n+/- 3.1 degrees. The total CO mass, as calculated from the optically thin C18O\nline, is about (4-8) x 10^-2 M_Earth, while the CO line ratios suggest a\nradiation temperature on the order of 6-9 K. Comparing our results with those\nobtained for the dust component of the HD 21997 disk from the ALMA continuum\nobservations by Mo\\'or et al., we conclude that comparable amounts of CO gas\nand dust are present in the disk. Interestingly, the gas and dust in the HD\n21997 system are not co-located, indicating a dust-free inner gas disk within\n55 AU of the star. We explore two possible scenarios for the origin of the gas.\nA secondary origin, which involves gas production from colliding or active\nplanetesimals, would require unreasonably high gas production rates and would\nnot explain why the gas and dust are not co-located. We propose that HD 21997\nis a hybrid system where secondary debris dust and primordial gas coexist.

A determination of this\nmass-threshold is mandatory in order to understand how GCs form. We analyzed 9\nRGB stars belonging to the cluster Ruprecht 106. Targets were observed with the\nUVES@VLT2 spectrograph. Spectra cover a wide range and allowed us to measure\nabundances for light (O,Na,Mg,Al), alpha (Si,Ca,Ti), iron-peak\n(Sc,V,Cr,Mn,Fe,Co,Ni,Cu,Zn) and neutron-capture\n(Y,Zr,Ba,La,Ce,Pr,Nd,Sm,Eu,Dy,Pb) elements. Based on these abundances we show\nthat Ruprecht 106 is the first convincing example of a single population GC\n(i.e. a true simple stellar population), although the sample is relatively\nsmall. This result is supported also by an independent photometric test and by\nthe HB morphology and the dynamical state. It is old (~12 Gyrs) and, at odds\nwith other GCs, has no alpha-enhancement. The material it formed from was\ncontaminated by both s- and r- process elements. The abundance pattern points\ntoward an extragalactic origin. Its present day mass (M=10^4.83 Msun) can be\nassumed as a strong lower limit for the initial mass threshold below which no\nsecond generation is formed. Clearly, its initial mass must have been\nsignificantly greater but we have no current constraints on the amount of mass\nloss during its evolution.\n"}

Indicators of internal\nprocesses are consistent with this, examples are the power law dependence of\nthe power spectrum of auroral indices, and in-situ magnetic field observations\nin the earth's geotail.\n  An apparent paradox is that, rather than power laws, substorm statistics\nexhibit probability distributions with characteristic scales. Here we discuss a\nsimple sandpile model which yields for energy discharges due to internal\nreorganization a probability distribution that is a power law, whereas\nsystemwide discharges (flow of \"sand\" out of the system) form a distinct group\nwhose probability distribution has a well defined mean.\n  We analyse the model over a wide dynamic range whereupon two regimes having\ndifferent inverse power law statistics emerge, corresponding to\nreconfigurations over two distinct scaling regions: short scale sizes sensitive\nto the discrete nature of the sandpile model, and long scale sized up to the\nsystem size which correspond to the continuous limit of the model. The latter\nare anticipated to correspond to large scale systems such as the magnetosphere.\n  Since the energy inflow may be highly variable, we examined the response of\nthe model under strong or variable loading and established that the power law\nsignature of the large scale internal events persists.

The electrons are treated in the effective\nmass approximation and the magnetic moments are coupled with electrons by a\ndelta-like~$s-d$ interaction. The resulting GF is obtained by the exact\nsummation of the Born series using a generalization of the method developed by\nSlater-Koster and Ziman to non-commuting spin operators with the use of the\nWoodbury identities. The exact GF crucially depends on the value of the\none-electron GF at the origin, denoted as~$g_0$. The Born series is convergent\nonly if~$g_0$ is finite, which holds for electrons in parabolic energy bands\nin~$1D$, but not in~$2D$ and~$3D$. In the general case, the exact GF includes\nnonlinear combination of localized spins operators. A method of calculating\nmatrix elements of these operators is given. For spins~$S_a=S_b = 1/2$ the\nexact GF is expressed as a linear combination of components of~$\\hS_a, \\hS_b$,\nand the exact range function~${\\cal J}(r)$ is obtained as a double integral\nover analytical expression. For electron energy~$E=0$ and~$J g_0/2 = 2$ or~$J\ng_0/2=-2/3$ the range function and GF are singular. Poles of GF occur in the\nvicinities of singularity points and the resulting energies of bound states are\ncalculated. There are three regimes of~$J$. For small $J$ the range function\nresembles RKKY one: it has the same period~$\\pi/k_F$, the same decay character\nand a slightly different amplitude, usually within a few percent. This regime\noccurs for most frequently in the nature. For~$|J|$ comparable to~$|g_0|^{-1}$\nthe exact range function differs qualitatively from RKKY one,.

The resulting unique\ndecomposition of the Levi-Civita connection into its affine and nonmetric parts\nallows for a covariant definition of the gravitational energy-momentum tensor.\nIt is pointed out that the invariance of the Lagrangian (or action functional)\nis a necessary but not sufficient condition to secure the covariance of the\nLagrange-Euler field theory. A rigorous definition of the Lagrange Field\nStructure (LFS) on differential manifolds is proposed. A covariant\ngeneralization of the first Noether theorem for LFS is obtained. Different\napproaches to the EP are discussed.\n"}
{"id": "1604.06230", "abstract": "  Understanding how galaxies evolved from the early Universe through cosmic\ntime is a fundamental part of modern astrophysics. In order to study this\nevolution it is important to sample the galaxies at various times in a\nconsistent way through time. In regular luminosity selected samples, our\nanalyses are biased towards the brightest galaxies at all times (as these are\neasier to observe and identify). A complementary method relies on the\nabsorption imprint from neutral gas in galaxies, the so-called damped Ly-alpha\nabsorbers (DLAs) seen towards distant bright objects. This thesis seeks to\nunderstand how the absorption selected galaxies relate to the emission selected\ngalaxies by identifying the faint glow from the absorbing galaxies at redshift\nz~2.\n  In the last Chapter, a study of the more evolved, massive galaxies is\npresented. These galaxies are observed to be a factor of 2 to 6 times smaller\nthan local galaxies of similar masses. A new spectroscopically selected sample\nis presented and the increased precision of the redshifts allows a more\ndetailed measurement of the scatter in the mass-size relation. The size\nevolution of massive, quiescent galaxies is modelled by a `dilution' scenario,\nin which progressively larger galaxies at later times are added to the\npopulation of denser galaxies, causing an increase of the mean size of the\npopulation. This model describes the evolution of both sizes and number\ndensities very well, however, the scatter in the model increases with time,\ncontrary to the data. It is thus concluded that a combination of `dilution' and\nindividual growth, e.g., through mergers, is needed.\n  For brevity, the individual chapters based on published peer-reviewed\narticles are omitted and a link to the given article is given instead.\n  Principal supervisor: Johan P.

{"id": "astro-ph/0612327", "abstract": "  We use a set of cosmological N-body simulations to investigate the structural\nshape of galaxy-sized cold dark matter (CDM) halos. Unlike most previous work\non the subject - which dealt with shapes as measured by the inertia tensor - we\nfocus here on the shape of the gravitational potential, a quantity more\ndirectly relevant to comparison with observational probes. A further advantage\nis that the potential is less sensitive to the effects of substructure and, as\na consequence, the isopotential surfaces are typically smooth and well\napproximated by concentric ellipsoids. Our main result is that the asphericity\nof the potential increases rapidly towards the center of the halo. The radial\ntrend is more pronounced than expected from constant flattening in the mass\ndistribution, and reflects a strong tendency for dark matter halos to become\nincreasingly aspherical inwards. Near the center the halo potential is\napproximately prolate ((c/a)_0=0.72 +/- 0.04, (b/a)_0=0.78 +/- 0.08), but it\nbecomes increasingly spherical in the outer regions. The principal axes of the\nisopotential surfaces remain well aligned, and in most halos the angular\nmomentum tends to be parallel to the minor axis and perpendicular to the major\naxis. This suggests that galactic disks may form in a plane where the potential\nis elliptical and where its ellipticity varies rapidly with radius. This can\nresult in significant deviations from circular motion in systems such as low\nsurface brightness galaxies (LSBs), even for relatively minor deviations from\ncircular symmetry. Simulated long-slit rotation curves can appear similar to\nthose of LSBs often cited as evidence for constant density \"cores\".

In the vicinity of such a spacetime\nsingularity, the energy densities, spacetime curvatures, and all other physical\nquantities blow up. Despite exhaustive attempts over decades, the famous\nconjecture that the formation of a singularity during stellar collapse\nnecessarily accompanies the formation of an event horizon, thereby covering the\ncentral singularity, still remains without a proof. Moreover, there are\nexamples of stellar collapse models with reasonable matter contribution in\nwhich an event horizon does not form at all, giving rise to a naked singularity\nfrom which both matter and radiation can fall in and come out. These examples\nsuggest that the so-called cosmic censorship conjecture may not be a general\nrule. Therefore one must embark upon analysis of realistic theoretical models\nof gravitational collapse and gradually generalizing previous efforts.\n"}

We simulate such binaries with the use of a\nsmoothed particle hydrodynamics code. The main effects of the secondary on the\ndisc are its truncation and the accumulation of material inwards of truncation.\nWe find two cases with respect to the effects of eccentricity: (i) In circular\nor nearly circular prograde orbits, the disc maintains a rotating, constant in\nshape, configuration, which is locked to the orbital phase. The disc is smaller\nin size, more elongated and more massive for low viscosity parameter, small\norbital separation and/or high mass ratio. (ii) Highly eccentric orbits are\nmore complex, with the disc structure and total mass strongly dependent on the\norbital phase and the distance to the secondary.

We investigated the formation of absorption lines corresponding\nto the CO rotational transitions using three-dimensional non-LTE line transfer\nsimulations considering the dust thermal emission. As in Papers I--III of this\nseries, we performed post-processed radiative transfer calculations using the\n\"radiation-driven fountain model\" (wada2016}, which yields a geometrically\nthick obscuring structure around the nucleus. This model is consistent with the\nspectral energy distribution of the nearest type-2 Seyfert galaxy, the Circinus\ngalaxy. We found that the continuum-subtracted channel maps of $J = 4-3$ and\nhigher transitions show absorption regions along the disk mid-plane for an\nedge-on viewing angle. The spectra consist of multiple absorption and emission\nfeatures, reflecting the internal inhomogeneous and turbulent structure of the\ntorus. The deepest absorption feature is caused by the gas on the near-side of\nthe torus between $r =10$ and 15 pc, which is located in front of the\nAGN-heated dust inside $r \\simeq 5$ pc. We also found that a spatial resolution\nof 0.5--1.0 pc is necessary to resolve the absorption features. Moreover, the\ninclination angle must be close to the edge-on angle (i.e., $\\sim 85^\\circ$) to\nobserve the absorption features. The findings of the present study imply that\ncombining our radiation-hydrodynamic model with high-resolution observations of\nCO (7-6) by ALMA can provide new information about the internal structure of\nthe molecular tori in nearby AGNs.\n"}

A frequently proposed\nexplanation, apart from the possibility of having a third body, is the effect\nof magnetic activity, which may alter the internal structure of the secondary\nstar, particularly its quadrupole moment, and thereby cause quasi-periodic\noscillations. Here we present two compressible non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamical\n(MHD) simulations of the magnetic dynamo in a solar mass star, one of them with\nthree times the solar rotation rate (\"slow rotator\"), the other one with twenty\ntimes the solar rotation rate (\"rapid rotator\"), to account for the high\nrotational velocities in close binary systems. For the slow rotator, we find\nthat both the magnetic field and the stellar quadrupole moment change in a\nquasi-periodic manner, leading to O-C (observed - corrected times of the\neclipse) variations of ~0.025 s. For the rapid rotator, the behavior of the\nmagnetic field as well as the quadrupole moment changes become considerably\nmore complex, due to the less coherent dynamo solution. The resulting O-C\nvariations are of the order 0.13 s. The observed system V471~Tau shows two\nmodes of eclipsing time variations, with amplitudes of 151 s and 20 s,\nrespectively. However, the current simulations may not capture all relevant\neffects due to the neglect of the centrifugal force and self-gravity.\nConsidering the model limitations and that the rotation of V471 Tau is still a\nfactor of 2.5 faster than our rapid rotator, it may be conceivable to reach the\nobserved magnitudes.\n"}

Aims: We search for observational features that\nwould favour one scenario over the others by constraining the dissipation\nradius, the outflow magnetization or by indicating the presence of shocks.\nBursts showing peculiarities can emphasize the role of a specific physical\ningredient, which becomes more apparent under certain circumstances. Methods:\nWe study GRB 070110, which exhibited several remarkable features during its\nearly afterglow: a very flat plateau terminated by an extremely steep drop and\nimmediately followed by a bump. We model the plateau as photospheric emission\nfrom a long lasting outflow of moderate Lorentz factor ($\\Gamma\\sim 20$) which\nlags behind an ultra-relativistic ($\\Gamma> 100$) ejecta responsible for the\nprompt emission. We compute the dissipation of energy in the forward and\nreverse shocks resulting from this ejecta's deceleration by the external\nmedium. Results: Photospheric emission from the long-lasting outflow can\naccount for the plateau properties (luminosity and spectrum) assuming some\ndissipation takes place in the flow. The geometrical timescale at the\nphotospheric radius is so short that the observed decline at the end of the\nplateau likely corresponds to the shut-down of the central engine. The\nfollowing bump results from dissipated power in the reverse shock, which\ndevelops when the slower material catches up with the initially fast component,\nafter it had been decelerated.

While the former shows transitions to a gapped\nchiral QSL (CSL) and a gapless U(1) QSL before the polarized paramagnet sets\nin, the latter gives way to a valance bond solid (VBS) phase with dimers on z\nbonds. Key to understanding this rich phenomenology is the Zeeman field induced\nhybridization between the $\\epsilon$ and majorana fermions resulting in a\n$\\psi$ fermion that leads to a gapped $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ QSL at intermediate\nmagnetic field and anisotropy -- dubbed the Primordial Fractionalized (PF)\nphase.

We start from the study\nof conditional pairwise-error probability (PEP) of the OTFS scheme, based on\nwhich its performance upper bound of the coded OTFS system is derived. Then, we\nshow that the coding improvement for OTFS systems depends on the squared\nEuclidean distance among codeword pairs and the number of independent\nresolvable paths of the channel. More importantly, we show that there exists a\nfundamental trade-off between the coding gain and the diversity gain for OTFS\nsystems, i.e., the diversity gain of OTFS systems improves with the number of\nresolvable paths, while the coding gain declines. Furthermore, based on our\nanalysis, the impact of channel coding parameters on the performance of the\ncoded OTFS systems is unveiled. The error performance of various coded OTFS\nsystems over high-mobility channels is then evaluated. Simulation results\ndemonstrate a significant performance improvement for OTFS modulation over the\nconventional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation over\nhigh-mobility channels.

In this paper, by taking\nhardware impairments into consideration, we conduct the joint transmit and\nreflect beamforming optimization, and reevaluate the system performance. First,\nwe characterize the closed-form estimators of direct and cascaded channels in\nboth single-user and multi-user cases, and analyze the impact of hardware\nimpairments on channel estimation accuracy.

It has been argued that the\nhalo population may produce a signal that is much stronger (factor of ~5 in\nspectral amplitude) than the disk population. However, this surprising result\nwas not based on an actual calculation of a halo white dwarf population but was\nderived on (i) the assumption that one can extrapolate the halo population\nproperties from those of the disk population and (ii) the postulated\n(unrealistically) high number of white dwarfs in the halo. We perform the first\ncalculation of a halo white dwarf population using population synthesis models.\nOur comparison with the signal arising from double white dwarfs in the Galactic\ndisk+bulge clearly shows that it is impossible for the double white dwarf halo\nsignal to exceed that of the rest of the Galaxy. Using microlensing results to\ngive an upper limit on the content of white dwarfs in the halo (~30 % baryonic\nmass in white dwarfs), our predicted halo signal is a factor of 10 lower than\nthe disk+bulge signal. Even in the implausible case where all of the baryonic\nhalo mass is found in white dwarfs, the halo signal does not become comparable\nto that of the disk+bulge, and thus would still have a negligible effect on the\ndetection of other LISA sources.\n"}

Anisotropic outflows follow the path\nof least resistance and thus travel preferentially into low-density regions,\naway from cosmological structures where galaxies form. These anisotropic\noutflows are less likely to overlap with one another, or to hit pre-galactic\ncollapsing halos and strip them of their gas, preventing a galaxy from forming.\nGoing from 180 deg to 60 deg, the number of galaxies that actually form\ndoubles, producing twice as many outflows, and these outflows overlap to a\nlesser extent. As a result, the metal volume filling factor of the IGM goes\nfrom 8% for isotropic outflows up to 28% for anisotropic ones. High density\nregions are more efficiently enriched than low density ones (~80% compared to\n~20% by volume), even though most enriched regions are low densities.\nIncreasing the anisotropy of outflows increases the extent of enrichment at all\ndensities, low and high.

Further we find that\nthe Schmidt scaling law, by itself, does not provide an adequate description of\nstar formation activity in GMCs. Because the total number of protostars\nproduced by a cloud is given by the product of Sigma*(A_K) and S'(> A_K), the\ndifferential surface area distribution function, integrated over the entire\ncloud, the cloud's structure plays a fundamental role in setting the level of\nits star formation activity.

Next, a secular change in the\nastronomical unit AU is definitely a concern. It is increasing by about 15 cm\nyr$^{-1}$. The other two anomalies are perhaps less disturbing because of known\nsources of nongravitational acceleration. The first is an apparent slowing of\nthe two Pioneer spacecraft as they exit the solar system in opposite\ndirections.

{"id": "1804.03672", "abstract": "  To investigate the role of bars in the chemical evolution of isolated disc\ngalaxies, we performed a series of 39 gas dynamical simulations of isolated\nbarred and unbarred galaxies with various masses, initial gas fractions, and\nAGN feedback models. The presence of a bar drives a substantial amount of gas\ntoward the central region of the galaxy. In the most massive galaxies, this\nresults in a violent starburst, followed by a drop in star formation resulting\nfrom gas exhaustion. The time delay between Type Ia and Type II supernovae\nexplosions means that barred galaxies experience a rapid increase in [O/H] in\nthe central region, and a much more gradual increase in [Fe/H]. In unbarred\ngalaxies, star formation proceeds at a slow and steady rate, and oxygen and\niron are produced at steady rates which are similar except for a time offset.\nComparing the abundance ratios in barred and unbarred galaxies with the same\ncentral stellar mass $M_*$, we find in barred galaxies an enhancement of 0.07\ndex in [O/H], 0.05 dex in [Fe/H], and 0.05 dex in [O/Fe]. The [O/H] enhancement\nis in excellent agreement with observations from the SDSS. The initial gas\nfraction has very little effect on the abundance ratios in barred and unbarred\ngalaxies, unless the galaxies experience a starburst.

In the hard state, the variability can be\nexplained by softening the overall spectrum with a pivot at 50 keV and another,\nindependent variability pattern where the spectral shape does not change when\nthe luminosity changes. In the soft state, the variability is caused by a\nvariable hard tail of a constant shape superimposed on a constant soft\ncomponent. These variability patterns are in agreement with the\nenergy-dependent rms variability in the two states. We also study in detail\nrecent soft states in 2000-02.

In this\nwork, we study one such color-color selection tool -- the rest-frame $U-V$ vs.\n$V-J$ diagram -- by employing mock observations of cosmological galaxy\nformation simulations. In particular, we conduct numerical experiments\nassessing both trends in galaxy properties in UVJ space and the color-color\nevolution of massive galaxies as they quench at redshifts $z\\sim 1$--$2$. We\nfind that our models broadly reproduce the observed UVJ diagram at $z=1$--$2$,\nincluding (for the first time in a cosmological simulation) reproducing the\npopulation of extremely dust-reddened galaxies in the top right of the UVJ\ndiagram. However, our models primarily populate this region with low-mass\ngalaxies and do not produce as clear a bimodality between star-forming and\nquiescent galaxies as is seen in observations. The former issue is due to an\nexcess of dust in low-mass galaxies and relatively gray attenuation curves in\nhigh-mass galaxies, while the latter is due to the overpopulation of the green\nvalley in SIMBA. When investigating the time evolution of galaxies on the UVJ\ndiagram, we find that the quenching pathway on the UVJ diagram is independent\nof the quenching timescale, and instead dependent primarily on the average\nspecific star formation rate in the 1 Gyr prior to the onset of quenching. Our\nresults support the interpretation of different quenching pathways as\ncorresponding to the divergent evolution of post-starburst and green valley\ngalaxies.\n"}

In ErCrO3 the\nEr3+ Kramers doublet becomes active at about the TSR onset. Each line further\nexperiences Zeeman splitting under magnetic fields while an spin reversal\ninduced by a 2.5 T field, back to the Gamma4 (Fz) from the Gamma1 phase at 2 K,\nproduces a secondary splitting. The 5 K AFM and FM excitations in ErCrO3 have a\nconcerted frequency-intensity temperature dependence and a shoulder pointing to\nthe Er3+ smaller ion size also disrupting the two magnetic sublattice\napproximation . Both resonances reduce to one when the temperature is lowered\nto 2 K in the Gamma1 representation.\n"}

An\nMRN size distribution is accounted for by estimating an effective grain\nabundance and Hall parameter for single-size grains.\n  A one-parameter family of intermediate shocks exists for each shock speed v_s\nbetween the intermediate signal speed v_A cos theta and sqrt{2} v_A cot theta,\nwhere v_A is the preshock Alfven speed and theta is the angle between the\npreshock magnetic field and the normal to the shock front. In addition, there\nis a unique fast shock for each v_s > v_A.\n  If the preshock density n_H is greater than about 10^5 cm^-3 and the preshock\nmagnetic field satisfies B(mG) less than about n_H(10^5 cm^-3) grains are\npartially decoupled from the magnetic field and the field and velocity\ncomponents within fast shocks do not lie in the plane containing the preshock\nfield and the shock normal.

We performed broadband\nspectroscopy in the 1-70 keV energy band using four observations made with\nSwift and NuSTAR at different intensity levels. Our timing results reveal the\npresence of highly variable pulse profiles dependent on both luminosity and\nenergy. Our spectroscopy results showed the presence of a cyclotron resonance\nscattering feature (CRSF) at ~30 keV. This feature at 30 keV is highly\nluminosity and pulse-phase dependent. Phase-averaged spectra during the last\ntwo observations, made close to the declining phase of the outburst showed the\npresence of this feature at around 30 keV. The existence of CRSF at 30 keV\nduring these observations is well supported by an abrupt change in the shape of\npulse profiles found close to this energy. We also found that 30 keV feature\nwas significantly detected in the pulse-phase resolved spectra of observations\nmade at relatively high luminosities. Moreover, all spectral fit parameters\nshowed a strong pulse phase dependence. In line with the previous findings, an\nabsorption feature at around 10 keV is significantly observed in the\nphase-averaged X-ray spectra of all observations and also showed a strong pulse\nphase dependence.\n"}

However, this measure is insufficient to\ndescribe the dynamics of realistic haloes, which are typically quite elongated.\nStudying the velocity distribution in massive DM haloes in cosmological\nsimulations, we find that in the inner parts of the haloes the local velocity\nellipsoids are strongly aligned with the major axis of the halo, the alignment\nbeing stronger for more relaxed haloes.

Abundance anomalies have been observed in field sdB stars and in\nnearly all Horizontal Branch (HB) stars of globular clusters with Teff > 11\n000K whatever be the cluster metallicity. Aims. The aim is to determine the\nabundance variations to be expected in sdB stars and in HB stars of\nmetallicities Z \\geq 0.0001 and what observed abundances teach us about\nhydrodynamical processes competing with atomic diffusion. Methods. Complete\nstellar evolution models, including the effects of atomic diffusion and\nradiative acceleration, have been computed from the zero age main-sequence for\nmetallicities of Z0 = 0.0001, 0.001, 0.004 and 0.02. On the HB the masses were\nselected to cover the Teff interval from 7000 to 37000K. Some 60 evolutionary\nHB models were calculated. The calculations of surface abundance anomalies\nduring the horizontal branch depend on one parameter, the surface mixed mass.\nResults. For sdB stars with Teff < 37000K and for HB stars with Teff > 11 000K\nin all observed clusters, independent of metallicity, it was found that most\nobserved abundance anomalies (even up to ~ x 200) were compatible, within error\nbars, with expected abundances.

Observations of globular cluster HB\nstars with Teff > 11 000K and of sdB stars with Teff < 37 000K suggest that\nmost observed abundance anomalies can be explained by element separation driven\nby radiative acceleration occuring at a mass fraction of ~1.E-7 M\\odot.

The\ntotal population of cosmic string loops in the Milky Way also produces a broad\nsignal that acts as a confusion noise. Both signals are enhanced by the\nclustering of loops gravitationally bound to the Galaxy, which significantly\ndecreases the average distance from the solar system to the nearest loop.\nNumerical estimates indicate that for dimensionless string tension G\\mu<\n10^{-11}, many loops are likely to be found in the Galactic halo.

We analyze 14 decaying\nregions and associated coronal holes occurring between early 2007 and late\n2010, four from cycle 23 and 10 from cycle 24. We investigate the relationship\nbetween asymmetries in active regions' positive and negative magnetic\nintensities, asymmetric magnetic decay rates, flux imbalances, global field\nstructure and coronal hole formation. Whereas new emerging active regions\ncaused changes in the large-scale coronal field, the coronal fields of the 14\ndecaying active regions only opened under the condition that the global coronal\nstructure remained almost unchanged. This was because the dominant\nslowly-varying, low-order multipoles prevented opposing-polarity fields from\nopening and the remnant active-region flux preserved the regions' low-order\nmultipole moments long after the regions had decayed. Thus the polarity of each\ncoronal hole necessarily matched the polar field on the side of the streamer\nbelt where the corresponding active region decayed. For magnetically isolated\nactive regions initially located within the streamer belt, the more intense\npolarity generally survived to form the hole.

Current models of human\ndynamics, used from risk assessment to communications, assume that human\nactions are randomly distributed in time and thus well approximated by Poisson\nprocesses. In contrast, there is increasing evidence that the timing of many\nhuman activities, ranging from communication to entertainment and work\npatterns, follow non-Poisson statistics, characterized by bursts of rapidly\noccurring events separated by long periods of inactivity. Here we show that the\nbursty nature of human behavior is a consequence of a decision based queuing\nprocess: when individuals execute tasks based on some perceived priority, the\ntiming of the tasks will be heavy tailed, most tasks being rapidly executed,\nwhile a few experience very long waiting times.

Our results show that the kinematics of S0 galaxies in field and\ncluster are, indeed, different.

Pion photoproduction on nuclei is discussed within a chiral\nconstituent quark model in which the quark degrees of freedom are explicitly\nintroduced through an effective chiral Lagrangian for the\nquark-pseudoscalar-meson coupling. The advantage of this model is that a\ncomplete set of nucleon resonances can be systematically included with a\nlimited number of parameters. Also, the systematic description of the nucleon\nand its resonances at quark level allows us to self-consistently relate the\nnuclear medium's influence on the baryon properties to the intrinsic dynamic\naspects of the baryons. As the simplest composite nucleus, the deuteron\nrepresents the first application of this effective theory for meson\nphotoproduction on light nuclei. The influence of the medium on the transition\noperators for a free nucleon is investigated in the Delta resonance region. No\nevidence is found for a change of the Delta properties in the pion\nphotoproduction reaction on the deuteron since the nuclear medium here involves\njust one other nucleon and the low binding energy implies low nuclear density.\nHowever, we show that the reaction mechanism is in principle sensitive to\nchanges of Delta properties that would be produced by the denser nuclear medium\nof heavier nuclei through the modification of the quark model parameters.\n"}
